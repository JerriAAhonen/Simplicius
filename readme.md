# FPS Project

This FPS project (code name Simplicius) is for exploring the process of creating an fps game.

## How to play

Open the "SampleScene" scene and press play. 

Movement: W/A/S/D to move, Q/E to lean, SPACE to jump, R to reload.

The weapon attachments can be switched with H/J. Note that the scope sight is WIP, needing an additional camera to handle the actual zooming of the scope lens.

## Features

- Weapon Attachments with affecting stats to weapon handling
- IK rig for first person hands, with support to dynamically update when changing weapons
- ADS with affecting stats to weapon handling
- ADS properties calculated at runtime for each attachment for easier implementation of new attachments
